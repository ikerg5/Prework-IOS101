App Idea: Instacook (not very sure of the name)
I want to build an app that analyzes ingredients from a picture and instantly suggests all the recipes you can make with them. It will provide step-by-step cooking instructions and video tutorials to guide users through the process. For those who already know what they want to eat, you can also search for recipes. By combining AI-powered image recognition with personalized meal recommendations, this app will help people who struggle with deciding what to cook while making the most of the ingredients they have.
